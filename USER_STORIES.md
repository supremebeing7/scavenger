##INCOMPLETE

* As a registered user, I want to be able to remove places and edit or delete each crawl, all from the same screen.

* As a registered user, I want to be able to favorite other user-created hunts/crawls so I can more easily find them next time.

* As a registered user, I want to add notes and pictures to a crawl I've completed.
(COMBINE THESE TWO??)

* As an unregistered user, I want to search for hunts/crawls by location or by names of places on the crawl.

* As a registered user, I want to follow other users so that I can see any new crawls they make.
